  abstract={
    Bipolaronic superconductivity is an exotic pairing mechanism proposed for materials like Ba_(1-x) K_x Bi O_3 (BKBO);
    however, conclusive experimental evidence for a (bi)polaron metallic state in this material remains elusive.
    Here, we combine resonant inelastic x-ray and neutron total scattering techniques with advanced modelling to study the local lattice distortions,
    electronic structure, and electron-phonon coupling (e-ph) in BKBO as a function of doping. Data for the parent compound (x=0) indicates that
    the electronic gap opens in predominantly oxygen-derived states strongly coupled to a long-range ordered breathing distortion of the oxygen sublattice.
    Upon doping, short-range breathing distortions and sizable (e-ph) coupling persist into the superconducting regime (x=0.4).
    Comparisons with exact diagonalization and determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations further support this conclusion.
    Our results provide compelling evidence that BKBO's metallic phase hosts a liquid of small (bi)polarons derived from local breathing distortions
    of the lattice, with implications for understanding the low-temperature superconducting instability

  abstract={
    A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures Tc is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures.
    For example, quantum materials could, in principle, be coupled with other materials to produce a more robust superconducting state.
    In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its Tc by hybridizing the system with a metal.
    Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength -|U|.
    In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization 𝑡⊥ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of Tc, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum Tc observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches.
    In the intermediate coupling regime, when -|U| is close to the value associated with the maximum Tc of the single-layer model, increasing t⏊ tends to decrease Tc, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned.
    Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Phys. B: Condens. Matter 318, 61 (2002)].

    Electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions arise in many strongly correlated quantum materials from the modulation of the nearest-neighbor hopping integrals, as in the celebrated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model.
    Nevertheless, relatively few nonperturbative studies of correlated SSH models have been conducted in dimensions greater than one, and those that have been done have primarily focused on bond models, where generalized displacements independently modulate each hopping integral.
    We conducted a sign-problem free determinant quantum Monte Carlo study of the optical SSH-Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice, where site-centered phonon modes simultaneously modulate pairs of nearest-neighbor hopping integrals.
    We report the model's low-temperature phase diagram in the challenging adiabatic regime.
    It exhibits insulating antiferromagnetic Mott and bond-order-wave (BOW) phases with a narrow region of coexistence between them. We also find that a critical e-ph coupling is required to stabilize the BOW phase in the small U limit.
    Lastly, in stark contrast to recent findings for the model's bond variant, we find no evidence for a long-range antiferromagnetism in the pure (U/t=0) optical SSH model.

    The high-temperature superconducting cuprates host unidirectional spin- and charge-density-wave orders that can intertwine with
    superconductivity in non-trivial ways. While the charge components of these stripes have now been observed in nearly all cuprate
    families, their detailed evolution with doping varies across different materials and at high and low temperatures.
    We address this problem using non-perturbative determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations for the three-band Hubbard model.
    Using an efficient implementation, we can resolve the model's fluctuating spin and charge modulations and map their evolution
    as a function of the charge transfer energy and doping. We find that the incommensurability of the charge modulations is decoupled
    from the spin modulations and decreases with hole doping, consistent with experimental measurements at high temperatures.
    These findings support the proposal that the high-temperature charge correlations are distinct from the intertwined stripe order
    observed at low-temperature and in the single-band Hubbard model.

    Theoretical studies suggest that Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions can

    Here we present a comparative analysis of the pairing and competing
    charge/bond correlations in the two-dimensional Holstein and optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)
    models using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo. We find that the SSH interactions support light bipolarons
    and strong superconducting correlations out to relatively large values
    of the e-ph coupling and densities near half-filling, while the Holstein interaction does not due
    to the formation of heavy bipolarons and competing charge-density-wave order. We further find
    that the Holstein and SSH models have comparable pairing correlations in the weak coupling limit
    for dilute carrier concentrations, where competing orders and polaronic effects are absent. These
    results support the proposal that SSH (bi)polarons can support superconductivity to larger values
    of the e-ph coupling in comparison to the Holstein polaron, but that the resulting Tc gains are small in the weak
    coupling limit. We also find that the SSH model's pairing correlations are suppressed after including
    a weak on-site Hubbard repulsion. These results have important implications for identifying and

    We introduce methodologies for highly scalable quantum Monte Carlo simulations of electron-phonon models, and report benchmark results for the Holstein model

    but incurs a computational cost that scales cubically with system size. Alternatively, near-linear scaling with system size can be achieved with the
    hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method and an integral representation of the Fermion determinant. Here, we introduce a collection of methodologies that make such
    simulations even faster. To combat "stiffness" arising from the bosonic action, we review how Fourier acceleration can be combined with time-step splitting.
    To overcome phonon sampling barriers associated with strongly-bound bipolaron formation, we design global Monte Carlo updates that approximately respect
    particle-hole symmetry. To accelerate the iterative linear solver, we introduce a preconditioner that becomes exact in the adiabatic limit of infinite atomic mass.
    Finally, we demonstrate how stochastic measurements can be accelerated using fast Fourier transforms. These methods are all complementary and, combined,
    may produce multiple orders of magnitude speedup, depending on model details.

  abstract={
    We investigate charge ordering in the Holstein model in the presence of anisotropic hopping, $t_x, t_y = 1−\delta, 1+\delta$, as a model of the effect of strain on charge density wave (CDW) materials.
    Using Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the CDW transition temperature is relatively insensitive to moderate anisotropy $\delta \leq 0.3$, but begins to decrease more rapidly at $\delta \geq 0.4$.
    However, the density correlations, as well as the kinetic energies parallel and perpendicular to the compressional axis, change significantly for moderate $\delta$.
    Accompanying mean-field theory calculations show a similar qualitative structure, with the transition temperature relatively constant at small δ and a more rapid decrease for larger strains.
    We also obtain the density of states $N(\omega)$, which provides clear signal of the charge ordering transition at large strain, where finite size scaling of the charge structure factor is extremely difficult
    because of the small value of the order parameter.
