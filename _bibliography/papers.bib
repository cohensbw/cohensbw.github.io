  abstract={
    Theoretical studies suggest that Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions can
    mediate high-temperature bipolaronic superconductivity that is robust against repulsive electronelectron interactions.
    Here we present a comparative analysis of the pairing and competing
    charge/bond correlations in the two-dimensional Holstein and optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)
    models using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo. We find that the SSH interactions support light bipolarons
    and strong superconducting correlations out to relatively large values
    of the e-ph coupling $\lambda$ and densities near half-filling, while the Holstein interaction does not due
    to the formation of heavy bipolarons and competing charge-density-wave order. We further find
    that the Holstein and SSH models have comparable pairing correlations in the weak coupling limit
    for dilute carrier concentrations, where competing orders and polaronic effects are absent. These
    results support the proposal that SSH (bi)polarons can support superconductivity to larger values
    of $\lambda$ in comparison to the Holstein polaron, but that the resulting $T_c$ gains are small in the weak
    coupling limit. We also find that the SSH model's pairing correlations are suppressed after including
    a weak on-site Hubbard repulsion. These results have important implications for identifying and
    engineering bipolaronic superconductivity.

  abstract={
    We compare the acoustic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with two of its optical variants where
    the phonons are defined on either on the sites or bonds of the system. First, we discuss how to make
    fair comparisons between these models in any dimension by ensuring their dimensionless coupling
    $\lambda$ and relevant phonon energies are the same. We then use determinant quantum Monte Carlo to
    perform non-perturbative and sign-problem-free simulations of all three models on one-dimensional
    chains at and away from half-filling. By comparing the results obtained from each model, we
    demonstrate that the optical and acoustic models produce near identical results within error bars for
    suitably chosen phonon energies and $\lambda$ at half-filling. In contrast, the bond model has quantitatively
    different behavior due to its coupling to the $q = 0$ phonon mode. These differences also manifest in
    the total length of the chain, which shrinks for the bond model but not for the acoustic and optical
    models when $\lambda \ne 0$. Our results have important implications for quantum Monte Carlo modeling of
    SSH-like interactions, where these models are sometimes regarded as being interchangeable.

    We consider a class of Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations suitable for treating Hubbard interactions in the context of quantum Monte Carlo simulations.
    A tunable parameter $p$ allows usto continuously vary from a discrete Ising auxiliary field $(p = \infty)$ to a compact auxiliary field that
    couples to electrons sinusoidally $(p = 0)$. In tests on the single-band square and triangular Hubbard models, we find that the severity of the sign problem
    decreases systematically with increasing $p$. Selecting $p$ finite, however, enables continuous sampling methods like the Langevin or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
    methods. We explore the tradeoffs between various simulation methods through numerical benchmarks.

    The relationship between electron-phonon ($e$-ph) interactions and charge-density-wave (CDW) order in the bismuthate family of high-temperature superconductors
    remains unresolved. We address this question using nonperturbative hybrid Monte Carlo calculations for the parent compound BaBiO$_3$. Our model includes the
    Bi $6s$ and O $2p_\sigma$ orbitals and coupling to the Bi-O bond-stretching branch of optical phonons via modulations of the Bi-O hopping integral.
    We simulate three-dimensional clusters of up to 4000 orbitals, with input model parameters taken from  ab initio electronic structure calculations and
    a phonon energy $\hbar\Omega_0 = 60$~meV. Our results demonstrate that the coupling to the bond-stretching modes is sufficient to reproduce the CDW transition
    in this system, despite a relatively small dimensionless coupling. We also find that the transition deviates from the weak-coupling Peierls' picture. This work
    demonstrates that off-diagonal $e$-ph interactions in orbital space are vital in establishing the bismuthate phase diagram.

  abstract={
    We introduce methodologies for highly scalable quantum Monte Carlo simulations of electron-phonon models, and report benchmark results for the Holstein model
    on the square lattice. The determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method is a widely used tool for simulating simple electron-phonon models at finite temperatures,
    but incurs a computational cost that scales cubically with system size. Alternatively, near-linear scaling with system size can be achieved with the
    hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method and an integral representation of the Fermion determinant. Here, we introduce a collection of methodologies that make such
    simulations even faster. To combat "stiffness" arising from the bosonic action, we review how Fourier acceleration can be combined with time-step splitting.
    To overcome phonon sampling barriers associated with strongly-bound bipolaron formation, we design global Monte Carlo updates that approximately respect
    particle-hole symmetry. To accelerate the iterative linear solver, we introduce a preconditioner that becomes exact in the adiabatic limit of infinite atomic mass.
    Finally, we demonstrate how stochastic measurements can be accelerated using fast Fourier transforms. These methods are all complementary and, combined,
    may produce multiple orders of magnitude speedup, depending on model details.

    Over the past several years, reliable Quantum Monte Carlo results for the charge density wave transition temperature $T_{cdw}$ of the half-filled

    We investigate charge ordering in the Holstein model in the presence of anisotropic hopping, $t_x, t_y = 1−\delta, 1+\delta$, as a model of the effect of strain on charge density wave (CDW) materials.
    Using Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the CDW transition temperature is relatively insensitive to moderate anisotropy $\delta \leq 0.3$, but begins to decrease more rapidly at $\delta \geq 0.4$.
    However, the density correlations, as well as the kinetic energies parallel and perpendicular to the compressional axis, change significantly for moderate $\delta$.
    Accompanying mean-field theory calculations show a similar qualitative structure, with the transition temperature relatively constant at small δ and a more rapid decrease for larger strains.
    We also obtain the density of states $N(\omega)$, which provides clear signal of the charge ordering transition at large strain, where finite size scaling of the charge structure factor is extremely difficult
    because of the small value of the order parameter.

    The Holstein model is a paradigmatic description of the electron-phonon interaction, in which electrons couple to local dispersionless phonon modes,
    independent of momentum. The model has been shown to host a variety of ordered ground states such as charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity
    on several geometries, including the square, honeycomb, and Lieb lattices. In this work, we study CDW formation in the Holstein model on the kagome lattice,
    using a recently developed hybrid Monte Carlo simulation method. We present evidence for CDW order at an average electron filling of
    $\langle n \rangle = 2/3$ per site, with an ordering wavevector at the $K$-points of the Brillouin zone. We estimate a phase transition occurring at
    $T_{c} \approx t/18$, where $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping parameter. Our simulations find no signature of CDW order at other electron fillings or
    ordering momenta for temperatures $T \geq t/20$.

    In a recent work by Schrodi et al. [Phys. Rev. B 104, L140506 (2021)], the authors find an unconventional superconducting state with a
    sign-changing order parameter using the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, including the first vertex correction.
    This unconventional solution arises despite using an isotropic bare electron-phonon coupling in the Hamiltonian.
    We examine this claim using hybrid quantum Monte Carlo for a single-band Holstein model with a cuprate-like noninteracting band structure
    and identical parameters to Schrodi et al. Our Monte Carlo results for these parameters suggest that unconventional pairing correlations do not
    exceed their noninteracting values at any carrier concentration we have checked.
    Instead, strong charge-density-wave correlations persist at the lowest accessible temperatures for dilute and nearly half-filled bands.
    Lastly, we present arguments for how vertex-corrected Migdal-Eliashberg calculation schemes can lead to uncontrolled results in the presence of Fermi surface nesting.

    We study the effects of anharmonicity on the physics of the Holstein model, which describes the coupling of itinerant fermions and localized quantum phonons,

    We find that the presence of this anharmonic term reduces the extent of the charge density wave phase (CDW) at half-filling
    as well as the transition temperature to this phase.
    Doping away from half-filling, we observe a first order phase transition between the CDW and a homogeneous phase which is also present in the harmonic model.
    In addition, we study the evolution of the superconducting susceptibility in the doped region and show that anharmonicity can enhance the superconducting response.
